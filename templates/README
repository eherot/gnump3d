templates directory
-------------------

  This directory contains one subdirectory for every theme the server
 includes.  The directory name is listed as the name of the theme in
 the server preferences page.

  Each theme is a simple collection of HTML files which are read and
 used as templates for all the output pages.


Markup
------

  The HTML files may contain special markup which includes variables
 like:

	$VERSION
             To be replaced with the CVS version of the code.

	$RELEASE
             To be replaced with the release number of the code.

	$HOSTNAME
             The name of the machine the server is running upon.



Inclusion
---------

  Also templates may include the output of external commands, or other
 files, via a server-side-include syntax.  For example the following
 are both valid lines:

	<!-- include="header.tmpl" -->
	<!-- exec="/bin/cmd arguments .." -->


Theme Creation
--------------

  For more details of theme creation please study those included here,
 or read the documentation online at the following URL:

Theme Specific Display
----------------------

  Themes may contain their own appearence in terms of the song and
 directory format listings.

  This is specified by copying the 'directory_format', and 'file_format'
 from the gnump3d.conf and placing it inside a configuration file for
 the theme.  This file must be called 'config.ini'.

  Also for listing the theme creator the contents of the file AUTHOR
 are displayed literally in the preferences page.
