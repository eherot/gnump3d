gnump3d downsampling
--------------------

  GNUMP3d is pretty flexible when it comes to server media files, if you 
 wish each file type supported can be processed by an arbitary program.

  This allows you to perform on the fly bitrate changing, which can
 be useful for streaming media from a home machine to your place of
 work - for example.


Enabling
--------

  The configuration file /etc/gnump3d/gnump3d.conf has a single 
 setting which is responsible for the enabling or disabling of 
 this support.

  To enable it ensure you have the following line, uncommented:

# Enable downsampling.
downsample_enabled = 1

  If this is disabled the GUI will not show any downsampling options
 and all the other settings are ignored.



Specifying Filter Programs
--------------------------

  If the downsampling is enabled then the server will attempt to 
 stream the files through a filter, for the correct quality.

  The filters are setup in terms of the suffix of the media file.
 This means that you may have a different program downsampling
 MP3 and OGG files.

  The general setup involves having three lines of the form:

downsample_"level"_"suffix"

  For example:

downsample_high_mp3   = /usr/bin/lame  --mp3input -b 56 $FILENAME -
downsample_medium_mp3 = /usr/bin/lame  --mp3input -b 32 $FILENAME -
downsample_low_mp3    = /usr/bin/lame  --mp3input -b 16 $FILENAME -

  These lines will specify the command that all MP3 files are passed
 through at the given quality level.

  (The file suffixes are treated case insensitively).




Controlling Downsampling
------------------------

  Downsampling is controlled by the IP address of the client which
 requests a song.

  This is deliberate as the server is mostly designed for use on
 a LAN; so all the local machines will be expected to have the
 full quality songs, and any remote machines will be downsampled.

  To control the downsampling you will need to adjust *both* of
 the following settings:


downsample_clients    = XXX
no_downsample_clients = YYY

  Valid values are either 'all', 'none' or a range of IP addresses, such 
 as '192.168.0/24'.  Multiple values may be seperated by ';' characters.

  A typical setup would look like this:


#
#  Downsample for all clients
#
downsample_clients = all

#
#  EXCEPT local ones
#
no_downsample_clients = 192.168.0/24; 127.0.0.1

  
  As you can see 'no_downsample_clients' takes precedence over the
 first setting.
