PREREQUISITES
=============


  GNUMP3d has only one requirement - a working Perl installation with the
 fork() function implemented.

  In practice this means some for of Unix system, or a Microsoft Windows
 system with a very recent version of ActiveState's Perl port.


INSTALLATION
============

  GNUMP3d installation should require no more than the 
 following:-

	make install

  This will install the software in /usr/bin, with the
 configuration files in /etc/gnump3d/


CONFIGURATION
=============

  The configuration file will certainly need to be edited prior to starting
 the server for the first time.

  The configuration file is called 'gnump3d.conf' and should be found in 
 '/etc/gnump3d' under Unix-like operating systems, or 'etc\gnump3d' when 
 running under Microsoft Windows platforms.

  Before the server is available for serving music it must scan your
 audio files to build up a cache of song information.  This is a simple process
 which shouldn't take long.


STATISTICS
==========

  Once the indexing of the music is complete you may dump statistics of your
 archive via the 'gnump3d-stats' program, by using the '--stats' argument.

  For example:

skx@undecided:~ $ gnump3d-index --stats
Total number of songs: 2115
Total size of archive: 7.6Gb (8187011676 bytes)
Total playlength     : 5 days, 18 hours, 6 mins 13 seconds

  This will demonstrate that the indexing has worked properly.
