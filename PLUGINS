GNUMP3d Plugins
---------------

  When the 2.9.9 release of GNUMP3d goes out there will be three
 types of plugins available:

	1.  Pre-processing requests.
	2.  Processing plugins.
	3.  Post-processing requests.

  Right now only the second is available, and that is yet incomplete.


Pre-Processing Plugins
----------------------

  This are arbitary plugins which are handed the incoming request
 from each client.

  They may modify, or rewrite, the incoming requests as they see
 fit.  Once this action has been performed the incoming request
 is untouchable - it has been discared.

  Possible use?  This could be used to handle the security features:

	1.  Sanitizing input paths.
	2.  Testing for denied/allowed clients by IP addresses.
	3.  Testing for valid usernames + passwords.



Processing Plugins
------------------

  These are the "standard" plugins, they are called by the server
 when incoming requests are made.

  For each request, /foo, the GNUMP3d server queries each available
 plugin:

	1.  Load plugin.
	2.  Call "wantPath( /foo' );"
	3.  If 'wantPath' returns true then the plugin handles
           the request via a call to 'handlePath'.



Post-Processing Plugins
----------------------

  This are arbitary plugins which are handed the complete text
 of the response - for any given MIME type.

  They may rewrite the output before the client sees it.


  Usage?  HTML Validation?
